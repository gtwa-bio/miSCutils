The goal of `miSCutils` is to collect the miscellaneous functions that
tend to get written and reused during single-cell analysis. Rather than
copy/pasting and using slightly modified versions repeatedly, this
package will serve as a common collection for version controlling and
re-distributing these utilities elsewhere. It **will not** contain any
novel data analysis or statistical methods. Functions will primarily be
wrappers for established packages and workflows.

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `miSCutils` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/gtwa-bio/PMIDlotteRy) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gtwa-bio/PMIDlotteRy")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
